# I-MAGE

Created using React.js/Redux/Redux-Thunk -
Styled with bootstrap CSS.

Approach:
I started positioning the main elements and fetching the data from the main page, using mostly React components.
I continued by Posts.js. Implementing detailed info about the posts, as well as comments and replies.
Finishing, the stylization of all elements. 

API token Encrypted.

There's no Unit Implementation.
 

Color palette:
Tints & shadows of #4d5061

# Start app locally

## npm install

## npm run start

## Create a .env file with the token

### Instead of using localhost:3000 use {YOUR_IP}:3000
example: 124.169.2.137:3000
