# I-MAGE

Created using React.js/Redux/Redux-Thunk
styled with bootstrap CSS.

Approach:
I started positioning the main elements and fetching the data from the main page, using mostly React components.
then, I continued by Posts.js. Implementing detailed info about the posts, as well as comments and replies.
Finishing, the stylization of all elements. 
 

color palette:
Tints & shadows of #4d5061

# start app locally

##npm install

##npm run start

create a .env file with the token

instead of using localhost:3000 use {YOUR_IP}:3000
example: 124.169.2.137:3000
